# GOSU_Ruby_Music_Player
GOSU Music Player written in Ruby
The music player has the following functions:
- Switch between pages of albums on the albums window.
- Increase or decrease the volume, as well as mute/unmute.
- Move to the previous or the next song, play/pause the song.
- Move to the previous or the next album on the music player window.
- You can like a song to add it to the favourite tracks playlist (the favourite tracks album won't appear until at least one track is liked), you can also unlike the song to remove it from the favourite tracks playlist.
- Loop and Shuffle.
Everything works fine except the like button is kinda buggy.
